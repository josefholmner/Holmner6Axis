# Holmner6Axis

This project started in May 2020. Made By Josef Holmner.

A DIY 6 axis robot made from scratch. All the way from hardware, though software down to low level motor drivers.

New material will be uploded as the project progresses. One goal is to provide all material needed for anyone to build the same robot themselves. The current status of the project can be gathered by reading the progress below.

### Progress (list will be appended to along the way)
- [x] Rough 3d-model
- [ ] Refined 3d-model ready for printing
- [ ] Forward / backward kinematics prototype script
- [ ] Path generation prototype scripe
